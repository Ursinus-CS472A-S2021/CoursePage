* Comb Filter Vocoder (9.5/10)
Good overall!  I did want you to cut down the very last window and put it in. You can do that with this little hack
y[idx:idx+len(convole)] += convole[0:len(y[idx:idx+len(convole)])]
this works because if you go out of bounds at the end of a numpy slice, it simply cuts it down.  So you can look at the length of that


* Inverse STFT (8/8)
Good!

* STFT-Based Vocoder (7/7)
Good!


* Griffin-Lim (7/8)
Super, super close on this.  You just need to do an assignment to S at the end:
S = SAbs*np.exp(np.complex(0, 1)*phase)

Should be 
S = SAbs * np.exp(np.complex(0, 1)*P) 
We want to make a complex exponential out of the phases, so we need to raise e^(i*phases)


Musical Statement (4/4)
Good stuff
